<p> I am a first year graduate student at Princeton. Recently, I have joined the <a href="http://molbio.princeton.edu/labs/donia">Donia Lab</a> in the Molecular Biology Department. I want to apply computational approaches to biological problems, mentor students of underrepresented groups like myself, advocate for increasing diversity in STEM fields, and educate and encourage scientific curiosity in others.  </p>

### More Information


<p>I am an officer of the Princeton Data Science club and a member of the SACNAS Chapter in Princeton. </p>
